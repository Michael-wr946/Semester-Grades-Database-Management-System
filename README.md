#Student Data Management system.
The aim for the project was mainly focussed on the results published by my university, where they only release the grades and the Semester wise GPA based on roll no. Names are not displayed on the results making it tough to find out the relative performance. I had a pdf containig the names, roll numbers, email and date of birth of the students, so by using C++, I thought to combine the two pdfs and make a database of students with all their individual details including their SGPAs. I couldn't find a C++ library to work with PDFs so I copy pasted the entire the PDFs to two separate ".txt" files. "Names.txt" for the names, roll nos., email and DOB and "Grades.txt" for the SGPAs and roll no. of the students.

I used <fstream> header file to input the data from the two ".txt" files. I created a class called student where I stored all the data of each student. So I used a vector of students called "Database" to store data of all the studenst. I used the roll no as index as it was unique for each student eg: for Roll No = "B180001ME" "0001" was taken as the index. This made accesing individual students faster and easier.
